    content: `
      A gold loan is a secured loan that you can avail by pledging your gold ornaments as collateral. It is one of the quickest and easiest ways to get funds for your immediate financial needs.
      The loan amount depends on the value of the gold pledged. Lenders typically offer up to 75% of the market value of the gold.
      The interest rates on gold loans are generally lower than personal loans. The processing time is also minimal, with disbursal often happening on the same day.
      Repayment options are flexible, including paying interest upfront and the principal later, or through regular EMIs.
